            <p>COVID-19 vaccines help your body develop protection from the virus that causes
                COVID-19.
                Although vaccinated people sometimes get infected with the virus 
                that causes COVID-19, staying up to date on COVID-19 vaccines significantly lowers the risk of getting very sick, being hospitalized, or dying from COVID-19. CDC recommends that everyone 
                who is eligible get a booster and stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines, especially people with weakened immune systems.</p>
